                    <p>
                    You are most likely already a little bit familiar with this project,
                    as you are currently looking right at it. I created a portfolio page to display some of my projects,
                    and also to practice my web-development skills. This website is made with love, lots of yellow, and also
                    a little bit of React, TypeScript, and CSS for beautification.

                    Feel free to look at the  <a href = "https://github.com/camilladybdal/camilladybdal.com"> Github repository</a> for this project if you are curious as to how I made the beautiful hamburger menu ðŸ˜€
